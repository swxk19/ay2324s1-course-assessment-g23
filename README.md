# PeerPrep - CS3219 Grp 23

The latest deployment on google cloud can be found at http://peerprep.xyz. Make sure to go through [step 6](/README.md#steps) to access full features.

## Deployment

### Requirements

1. Docker: Version 24.0.5 or higher is required.
2. Docker Compose: Version 2.20.0 or higher is necessary.
3. Operating System: If deploying on a Linux server, only Ubuntu version 20.04 or Debian version 10 are acceptable.

### Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the `.env` file from canvas and place it into the root of this repository. (If you do not have access to the `.env` file, you can create a new file called `.env` with the `ENV_TYPE="prod"`, your `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and your `JWT_RS256_PRIVATE_KEY`).
3. Start the application by running the `start_containers.sh` script.

```
bash start_containers.sh
```

(Note: You might need to use sudo according to the permissions on your machine)

4. If you are deploying on a remote server, make sure to open port 80.
5. Access the website on your browser at `http://<your ip address>:80` (80 is the default port for a website). 
6. Since we're using http instead of https, you'll need to edit the permissions of the site to access all the features (specifically, for video chatting). Type `<your browser>://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` into your browser url (replace `<your browser>` with `chrome` for google chrome). This will bring you to the relevant settings. Add the url of your deployment (`http://<your ip address>:80` or `http://peerprep.xyz`) in the text box and enable this setting.
